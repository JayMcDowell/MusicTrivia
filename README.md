<h1>NSS--Music Trivia-Cul</h1>

<h4>Purpose</h4>

<ul>
    <li>This is for the Unit 2 (Ruby) Capstone project for Nashville Software School.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
    The contstraints of the project are that they must use standard ulbrary Ruby with the exception of being able to use ActiveRecord as an ORM. Future exceptions may be added, but the concept with this capstone is to demonstrate mastery of Ruby itself.</ul>

<ul>
    <li>The goal of this project is to create a quiz that will be rewarding to the user.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Project Status/To Do</h4>

<ul>
    <li>This project is currently in the planning stages</li>
</ul>

<h4>Features</h4>

<ul>
    <li>The music trivia quiz will include interaction with the user and some of the questions will be based on the user input.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Usage Instructions</h4>

<ul>
    <li>Planned usage is as follows:</li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>The game will ask for the user's name.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>The game will ask for the user's age.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>The user will be asked questions based on his/her age.</li>
</ul>

    <li>The game will ask the user to choose a category.  Choices will include 60's Rock & Pop, 70's Rock & Pop, 80's Rock & Pop, New Country, Classic Country, Jazz, Classical and an All Music Category. </li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>The quiz will be 20 questions.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>I want the user to be able to take the test multiple times and not see many questions twice.  This will require a multitude of questions that are accessed randomly.</li>
